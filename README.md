# Open4ES Shader Android
This is a shader project that runs on **Minecraft Java Edition for Android** using [GL4ES](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/gl4es-114-extra).

- I provide shaders for **Adreno, Mali, and PowerVR GPUs**.
- Just a little bit to spruce up your Minecraft look :)
- To download the shader, you can check here [Release](https://github.com/ahmaf-gif/Open4ES-Shader-Android/releases).

# Supported Launchers
- Fold Craft Launcher
- Pojav Glow Worm
- Zalith Launcher
- Pojav Launcher

# Known Issues
- On PowerVR and Mali GPUs, there are weird lines on the real-time shadows.
- On some devices that use a PowerVR GPU, performance can suddenly drop a lot.

- Please report if you find any other bugs!
